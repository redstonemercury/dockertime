This repo is intended as a learning tool to teach some basics of the Docker platform through demo files and exercises. It's meant to complement to the slides/talk found here: https://slides.com/jessicamajor/dockertime If you stumbled upon this, please enjoy, but you may be better off starting out with Docker's tutorials on thier site: https://docs.docker.com/engine/userguide/containers/dockerizing/
